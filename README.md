# Introduction

This is a fictional website (for educational purposes) for potential students to find basic information about **Hull College** in East Yorkshire, England. It gives basic information on the college's success, the courses offered and a way to contact them, so users can gauge the suitability of the college.

# UX and Design

## User Demographics

The target market are individuals who are wanting to find out more about the college to see if they want to enrol. It is not for current students.

## User Stories

1. As a potential student, I want to quickly see what courses are offered, so I can see if they are of interest.

2. As a potential student, I want to see some general "about" text, so I can confirm that I am on the correct site for my needs.

3. As a potential student, I want to see facts and figures on student satisfaction, so I can gauge whether I want to enrol.

4. As a potential student, I want to be able to contact the college, so that I can ask any questions I have.

## Changes to the design throughout development

The original design was slightly different to the above wireframes. The following particulars were changed during implementation to better the user experience and aesthetics:

The header was changed so that the logo was centered and the navigation drops underneath when the screen is reduced to a particular size. This meant that the navigation links did not get too close together.

Form labels were moved above their inputs, placeholders removed and all inputs and the submit button were stacked and the same width.

A map showing the colleges location was added to the contact section.

## Colour Scheme

Blue was chosen as the main colour for the site. Research had shown that this is a colour associated with reliability, productivity, trust and order, which are the principles the college wish to promote.

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was then used to find a mix of blues for the main colour palette, with the following decided upon:

- Header: #03045e ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/03045e/000000?text=+)
- About: #caf0f8 ![#caf0f8](https://via.placeholder.com/15/caf0f8/000000?text=+)
- Courses: #90e0ef ![#90e0ef](https://via.placeholder.com/15/90e0ef/000000?text=+)
- Contact: #00b4d8 ![##00b4d8](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00b4d8/000000?text=+)
- Footer: #0077b6 ![#0077b6](https://via.placeholder.com/15/0077b6/000000?text=+)

<img  src="assets/images/readme/blue-colours.jpg"  alt="Blue colour scheme from Coolors.co">

- Main text: #12130f ![#12130f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/12130f/000000?text=+)
- Navigation and footer text/icons: #fffafa ![#fffafa](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fffafa/000000?text=+)
- Accent color: #800080 ![#800080](https://via.placeholder.com/15/800080/000000?text=+)
- Submit button: #faf482 ![#faf482](https://via.placeholder.com/15/faf482/000000?text=+)

## Typography

[Typespiration](https://typespiration.com/) was used to find complimenting [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com) pairings, with the following decided upon:

- Headings: Roboto Condensed, with a fallback of sans-serif.
- Body: Poppins, with a fallback of sans-serif.

# Features

## Navigation and Header

The navigation bar allows the user to easily select which area of the site they wish to view. It will be located at the top of the site as this is common practice and is the area where most users eyes will be initially drawn to. It will be 'sticky', meaning it will stay at the top of the users screen even when they scroll the site. This is because the site is a one-page design and it is essential for the user to always be able to navigate the site wherever their current position. When a link is hovered over it becomes underlined to help the user confirm they are about to select the relevant link. The underline remains once selected and the relevant navigation link is highlighted when the site is scrolled.

The 'hamburger' icon was not used on small screens (where the navigation bar will collapse and be represented as three horizontal lines. When touched/clicked, this would reveal the navigation in a dropdown menu). This is often done due to the limited real estate space making the text hard to read when the screen is this size. However, this design was not used to make the site more easy to navigate for all users. Furthermore, the navigation only contains three links, so they have the space to remain next to each other still on small screens without causing accessibility and design issues. However, the logo will be centered and the navigation drop below at a particular screen width.

## Hero Image

An eye-catching full screen image is placed under the navigation. This helps grab the users attention and convey positive, professional feelings.

[Back to top ⇧](#Hull-College)

## About Information Box

A small box containing introductory information is placed below the hero image. This is eye-catching and quickly confirms to the user that they are on the correct site. It offers general information on the college, so users quickly get a feel for its achievements.

## Award Winning and Student Satisfaction

A brief description of the four awards the college has won is displayed under cartoon images of awards. Beneath these are statistics of student success and recommendations. These help to install confidence in the quality of the college and help conversion rates of those viewing the site to enrol. Larger screens display the awards and statistics four in a row, reducing to two and then stacked on top of each other as screens get smaller. This is to give the user the best experience in terms of accessibility and usability. These sections mirror each other to help give the site a sense of balance.

## Courses Section

This section contains images for the courses available at the college, so users can quickly see if they offer a course they are interested in. Icons from Font Awesome are used for the courses to add visual interest and to make each course quickly identifiable and more memorable. On large screens the courses are displayed three in a row, changing to two and then one as the screen gets smaller.

## Contact Section

This section allows the user to easily contact the college by using a form to send a message. The fields are clearly marked, all required and the email field must contain a valid email. The message is limited to 400 characters to keep them succinct and reduce the amount of characters needed to be stored in the database. The Submit button is a bright distinctive colour, acting as a call to action for the user.

A map showing the college's location is also included in this section, allowing users to quickly identify where the college is based.

*Please note the empty box on the left displays a map on the deployed site.*

## Footer

The footer feature at the bottom of the page contains links to Hull Colleges social media links. This will help users find more information and stay up to date with the college. The links open in a new tab, so users are not taken away from Hull College's website. They are the same colour as those in the navigation for consistency and to help them stand out.

# Features to Implement in the future

Add a dropdown to each course in the Courses section containing information on the course.

Add script to dynamically display how many characters are left for the form textarea.

Remove inline JavaScript in index.html into a separate script folder.  This was not done as it was outside the scope of the project.
 
The active navigation highlighting does not always work correctly on scroll.  This feature was not fixed as the use of JavaScript is outside the scope of the project.

# Technologies Used

## Main Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS

[Back to top ⇧](#Hull-College)

## Additional Languages Used
